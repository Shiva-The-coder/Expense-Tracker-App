# Expense-Tracker-App
The Enhanced Expense Tracker is a simple web-based application designed to help users track their expenses and earnings. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions, and it dynamically calculates the user's balance. The transactions are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage` so that they persist even when the page is refreshed.

### Features:
- Add transactions with descriptions and amounts.
- Track earnings and expenses separately.
- Edit or delete transactions.
- Display current balance and transaction list.
- Data is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring it persists across sessions.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and functionality.
- **LocalStorage** for persisting transactions.

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to start using the Expense Tracker.

## Usage:
1. **Add a Transaction:**
   - Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "Groceries").
   - Enter the amount.
   - Click on either "Earnings" or "Expense" to categorize the transaction.
   
2. **Edit a Transaction:**
   - Click on the transaction you want to edit. This will display the "edit" option.
   - Make your changes and save.

3. **Delete a Transaction:**
   - Click the trash icon next to the transaction you want to delete.
   - Confirm the deletion.
  

## Future Enhancements:
- Add charts (e.g., pie chart) for better visualization of earnings and expenses.
- Include authentication for multiple users.
- Allow users to categorize transactions (e.g., food, transportation, etc.).
